# Managing Table Relationships

Relationships between tables can be defined to let Insights know how to join the tables. 

To configure relationships, go to the **Data Sources** tab, select the data source, and click on the **Manage Relationships** button to open the relationships manager. Here you can drag and drop the tables to manage relationships between them.

To create a relationship, drag the column from one table to another. It is always a best practice to drag the column that is a primary key in the source table to the column that is a foreign key in the destination table.

To delete a relationship, click on the **Edge** that joins the two table columns and click on the **Delete** button.
