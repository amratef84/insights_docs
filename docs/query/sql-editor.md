# SQL Editor

The SQL Editor is for technical users who want to write their own SQL queries. It will be helpful to create complex queries that are not possible with the Query Builder.

You can choose the **SQL Editor** interface when creating a new query to open the SQL Editor.

::: tip
You can use the existing queries as a table in the SQL Editor by using `query_id` syntax. For example, if you have a query named `QRY-0245` then you can use it as a table in the SQL Editor by using `QRY-0245` syntax.
